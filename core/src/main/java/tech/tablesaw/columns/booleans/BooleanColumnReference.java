/**
 * A reference to a column that can be used in evaluating query predicates. It is a key part of having a fluent API
 * for querying tables.
 * <p>
 * Basically, it lets you write a query like this:
 * <p>
 * table.selectWhere(column("foo").isEqualTo("Bar"));
 * <p>
 * In that example, column() is a static method that returns a ColumnReference for a column named "foo".
 * The method isEqualTo(), is implemented on ColumnReference in a way that it can be applied to potentially, multiple
 * column types, although in this case, it only makes sense for CategoryColumns since the argument is a string.
 * <p>
 * When selectWhere() isExecuted, it supplies the table to the ColumnReference. The ColumnReference uses the table
 * and columnName to get access to the right column, and then fulfils its role by ensuring that the filtering
 * "isEqualTo("Bar") is applied to all the cells in the column.
