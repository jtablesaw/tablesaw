# Introduction

Tablesaw combines tools for working with tables and columns with the ability to create statistical models and visualizations. 

### What's a dataframe?
A dataframe is an in-memory, tabular data structure in which each column holds a single datatype, while rows can contain a variety of types. Tablesaw provide these operations:

* Importing and exporting data from text files and databases
* Adding and removing columns
* Sorting
* Filtering
* Creating new columns by applying functions to existing ones (mapping) 
* Summarizing columns or tables (reducing)
* Combining tables by appending or joining
* Calculating descriptive statistics
* Plotting data

### Looking ahead
In the rest of this User Guide we discuss each class of dataframe operation, as well as the visualization capabilities we offer.
