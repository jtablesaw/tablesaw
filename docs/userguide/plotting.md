## A Scatter Plot of Tornadoes

This US map image was created as a simple scatter plot of the starting latitude and longitude 
for every US tornado between 1950 and 2014. The code below loads the data, filters out missing records, 
and renders the plot:

```java
Table tornado = Table.createFromCsv("data/tornadoes_1950-2014.csv");
tornado = tornado.selectWhere(
        both(column("Start Lat").isGreaterThan(0),
             column("Scale").isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(0)));

Scatter.show("US Tornados 1950-2014",
        tornado.numberColumn("Start Lon"),
        tornado.numberColumn("Start Lat"));
```
These plots provide instant visual feedback to the analyst while she’s working. They’re for discovery, rather than for presentation, and so ease of use is stressed over beauty. Behind the scenes, the scatter plots are created with Tim Molter’s awesome XChart library: https://github.com/timmolter/XChart.

The following chart is taken from a baseball data set. It shows how to split a table on the values of one or more columns, 
producing a series for each group. In this case, we color the mark differently if the team made the playoffs. 

winsByYear

Here’s the code:

```java
    Table baseball = Table.createFromCsv("data/baseball.csv");
    Scatter.show("Regular season wins by year",
        baseball.numericColumn("W"),
        baseball.numericColumn("Year"),
        baseball.splitOn(baseball.column("Playoffs")));
```
Quantile Plot

A chart that looks like a scatter plot and works like a histogram is a Quantile Plot. 
The plot below presents the distribution of public opinion poll ratings for one US president.

bush_quantiles

This chart was build using the Quantile class:


````java
String title = "Quantiles: George W. Bush (Feb. 2001 - Feb. 2004)";
Quantile.show(title, bush.numericColumn("approval"));
````
