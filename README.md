Tablesaw
=======   
__Tablesaw__ is the shortest path to data science in Java. It includes a data-frame, an embedded column-store, and  hundreds of methods to transform, summarize, or filter data. If you work with data in Java, it will probably save you time and effort.

Tablesaw also supports descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning. And it scales: You can munge a 1/2 billion rows on a laptop and over 2 billion records on a server. 

There are other, more elaborate platforms for data science in Java. They're designed to work with vast amounts of data, and  require a huge stack and a vast amount of effort. All it takes to get started with Tablesaw is one maven dependency:  

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.lwhite1</groupId>
        <artifactId>tablesaw</artifactId>
        <version>0.7.7.2</version>
    </dependency>

### Documentation and support:

* You can find an introductory __tutorial__ here: https://jtablesaw.wordpress.com/an-introduction/ The early drafts of a __User Guide__ are also available on that site
* The __JavaDoc__ can be found here: http://lwhite1.github.io/tablesaw/apidocs/
* If you have __questions of any kind__: Ask them in the Issues section of this Repo.
 
### Tablesaw features: 

#### Data processing & transformation
* Import data from RDBMS and CSV files, local or remote (http, S3, etc.)
* Combine files
* Add and remove columns
* Sort, Group, Filter 
* Map/Reduce operations
* Store tables in a fast, compressed columnar storage format

#### Statistics and Machine Learning
* Descriptive stats: mean, min, max, median, sum, product, standard deviation, variance, percentiles, geometric mean, skewness, kurtosis, etc.
* Regression: Least Squares
* Classification: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests
* Clustering: k-Means, x-Means, g-Means
* Association: Frequent Item Sets, Association Rule Mining
* Feature engineering: Principal Components Analysis

#### Visualization
* Scatter plots
* Line plots
* Vertical and Horizontal Bar charts
* Histograms 
* Box plots
* Quantile Plots
* Pareto Charts

Here's an example where we use [XChart](https://github.com/timmolter/XChart) to map the locations of tornadoes:

You can see examples and read more about plotting in Tablesaw here: https://jtablesaw.wordpress.com/2016/07/30/new-plot-types-in-tablesaw/.

### Current performance:
You can load a 500,000,000 row, 4 column csv file (35GB on disk) entirely into about 10 GB of memory. If it's in Tablesaw's .saw format, you can load it in 22 seconds. You can query that table in 1-2 ms: fast enough to use as a cache for a Web app.

BTW, those numbers were achieved on a laptop.

### Easy to Use is Easy to Say
The goal in this example is to identify the production shifts with the worst performance. These few lines demonstrate __data import__, column-wise operations (__differenceInSeconds()__), filters (__isInQ2()__) grouping and aggegating (__median()__ and __.by()__), and (__top(n)__) calculations. 

```java
    Table ops = Table.createFromCsv("data/operations.csv");                             // load data
    DateTimeColumn start = ops.dateColumn("Date").atTime(ops.timeColumn("Start"));
    DateTimeColumn end = ops.dateColumn("Date").atTime(ops.timeColumn("End");
    LongColumn duration = start.differenceInSeconds(end);                        // calc duration
    duration.setName("Duration");
    ops.addColumn(duration);
    
    Table filtered = ops.selectWhere(                                            // filter
          allOf
              (column("date").isInQ2(),
              (column("SKU").startsWith("429")),
              (column("Operation").isEqualTo("Assembly"))));
   
    Table summary = filtered.median("Duration").by("Facility", "Shift");         // group medians
    FloatArrayList tops = summary.floatColumn("Median").top(5);                  // get "slowest"

```
